# A Galaxy Lacking Dark♂Matter

### NGC1052-DF2

##### Dragonfly Telephoto Array

a low- surface-brightness object with some substructure and a *spatial extent(空间延展)* of about 2′ 

##### Sloan Digital Sky Survey

a collection of point-like sources

- Apparent Size + Surface Brightness: Resembles *dwarf spheroidal galaxies(矮椭球星系)* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_spheroidal_galaxy>

- $\sim 20$ Mpc, associated with NGC1052

- Sérsic profile

  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sersic_profile>
  $$
  \ln I ( R ) = \ln I _ { 0 } - k R ^ { 1 / n }
  $$

  $$
  I ( R ) = I _ { e } \exp \left\{ - b _ { n } \left[ \left( \frac { R } { R _ { e } } \right) ^ { 1 / n } - 1 \right] \right\}
  $$

  where Sérsic Index $n=0.6, b/a=0.85$, small $n$ means it’s quite diffuse

- $R_e=22.6''/2.2$ kpc, central surface brightness $\mu(V_{606},0)=24.4$ mag$\cdot$ arcsec$^{-2}$ - *Ultra-Diffuse Galaxy(UDG)*

- $L_V=1.1\times10^8$ solar luminosities, $M_{stars}\approx2\times10^8$ solar masses

- 10 objects with a radial velocity $\sim1800$ km/s - a population of compact, luminous objects associated with NGC1052-DF2 

  - More extended than that of the smooth galactic light, $R_{gc}>R_{e}$
  - Globular clusters (morphologies & colours)
  - Higher luminosities than typical globular clusters
  - **Remarkably small spread among the velocities**, $\sigma_{obs}=8.4$ km/s, much smaller than that in previously studied UDGs in the Local Group -> small/low stellar mass
  - An estimate of the dynamical mass *(TME)*, $M_{dyn}<3.4\times10^8$ solar mass within $R_{out}=7.6$ kpc

- Different halo masses, $M_{halo}$ -> Enclosed mass (mass interior to a certain radius) compared to the expected mass from the stars alone

  - Large spatial extent & low dynamical mass -> robust constraint on $M_{halo}<10^8$ solar mass

  - Small virial radius ${\displaystyle r_{\rm {vir}}}=10$ kpc,

  - Expected to have $M_{halo}\approx6\times10^{10}$ solar mass, a factor of 400 higher
  - **Extremely defficient in dark matter**

- How the galaxy was formed?

  - Old tidal dwarf, formed from gas flung out of merging galaxies
    - blue colour, low metallicity: ?
  - Low metallicity gas swept up in quasar winds
    - large size & low surface brightness: ?
  - Inflowing gas fragmented before reaching NGC1052 - aided by jet-induced shocks

- Dark matter is separated from galaxies

  - A distinct ‘substance’ that may or may not exist in a galaxy
  - Falsify alternatives to dark matter
