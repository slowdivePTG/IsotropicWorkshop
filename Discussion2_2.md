# Current Velocity Data On Dwarf Galaxy NGC1052-DF2 Do Not Constrain It To Lack Darkâ™‚Matter

### NGC1052-DF2

- Velocity dispersion
  - vD18b: $\sigma_{rms}\sim14.3$ km/s
  - Biweight dispersion:  $\sigma_{rms}\sim8.4$ km/s - Removes potential outliers to the distribution
  - Results are sensitive to the technique used and to the way the uncertainties are handled

- Methods
  - Prior & Posterior PDF
  - MCMC
  - Monte Carlo Resampling
- Conclusion
  - Taking the uncertainties of velocity into account, $\sigma_{rms}$ should be larger
  - Too small sample
