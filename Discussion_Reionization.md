# Cosmic reionisation

## Historical preface

- Spectra of quasars
  - Strong radio radiation
  - Strangely placed, broad emission lines - hydrogen Balmer (principle quantum number *n* → 2) series lines redshifted by 16%
  - No strong absorption blueward of Ly$\alpha$ - IGM was **highly ionised** when
    the universe was only one-quarter of its present age of 13.8 billion years
- Cosmic reionisation
  - The process in which the IGM becomes ionised and heated
  - As the first generations of galaxies form, reionisation of IGM occurs everywhere in the IGM within a billion years after the Big Bang

## Background astrophysics

### Cosmology

### Large-scale structure

- The universe is homogeneous and isotropic at scales above 300 Mpc
  but below which forms large-scale structures (clusters, filaments, walls, and voids)

- Dark matter halos - building blocks of cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm

  - Gravitationally collapsed and decoupled from the expansion of the universe - DM and gas reach equilibrium between gravitational potential and its thermal and kinetic energy

  - A spherically symmetric halo collapsing in an expanding universe to find that its mean density of $18\pi^2$ times the critical density $ρ_c$ at the collapse time
    $$
    \rho_{\mathrm{h}}=18 \pi^{2} \rho_{\mathrm{c}}(1+z)^{3}
    $$

  - Halo radius
    $$
    r_{\mathrm{h}}=\left[\frac{M_{\mathrm{h}}}{(4 \pi / 3) \rho_{\mathrm{c}}(1+z)^{3}}\right]^{1 / 3}
    $$

  - Circular velocity
    $$
    V_{\mathrm{c}}=\sqrt{\frac{G M_{\mathrm{h}}}{r_{\mathrm{h}}}}
    $$

  - Virial temperature
    $$
    T_{\mathrm{vir}}=\frac{m V_{\mathrm{c}}^{2}}{2 k_{\mathrm{b}}}
    $$

### Ionisation and recombination

$$
\ce{H + \gamma <-> H+ + e-}
$$

- Cosmological H II regions - The radiation from the first luminous objects will ionise and heat the surrounding IGM once it escapes from their host halos
- Ionisation fraction estimation - equate these two rates and solve for the ionisation fraction $x_\text{e} \equiv n_\text{e}/n_\ce{H}$ of the gas at equilibrium
  - Recombination rate
    - The rate will be proportional to the product of the number density of protons and electrons
    - The gas is pure hydrogen ($n_\text{e} = n_\ce{p}$)
    - The rate depends on the temperature and into which quantum state *n* it recombines
