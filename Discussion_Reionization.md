# Cosmic reionisation

## Historical preface

- Spectra of quasars
  - Strong radio radiation
  - Strangely placed, broad emission lines - hydrogen Balmer (principle quantum number *n* → 2) series lines redshifted by 16%
  - No strong absorption blueward of Ly$\alpha$ - IGM was **highly ionised** when
    the universe was only one-quarter of its present age of 13.8 billion years
- Cosmic reionisation
  - The process in which the IGM becomes ionised and heated
  - As the first generations of galaxies form, reionisation of IGM occurs everywhere in the IGM within a billion years after the Big Bang

## Background astrophysics

### Cosmology

### Large-scale structure

- The universe is homogeneous and isotropic at scales above 300 Mpc
  but below which forms large-scale structures (clusters, filaments, walls, and voids)

- Dark matter halos - building blocks of cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm

  - Gravitationally collapsed and decoupled from the expansion of the universe - DM and gas reach equilibrium between gravitational potential and its thermal and kinetic energy

  - A spherically symmetric halo collapsing in an expanding universe to find that its mean density of $18\pi^2$ times the critical density $ρ_c$ at the collapse time
    $$
    \rho_{\mathrm{h}}=18 \pi^{2} \rho_{\mathrm{c}}(1+z)^{3}
    $$

  - Halo radius
    $$
    r_{\mathrm{h}}=\left[\frac{M_{\mathrm{h}}}{(4 \pi / 3) \rho_{\mathrm{c}}(1+z)^{3}}\right]^{1 / 3}
    $$

  - Circular velocity
    $$
    V_{\mathrm{c}}=\sqrt{\frac{G M_{\mathrm{h}}}{r_{\mathrm{h}}}}
    $$

  - Virial temperature
    $$
    T_{\mathrm{vir}}=\frac{m V_{\mathrm{c}}^{2}}{2 k_{\mathrm{b}}}
    $$

### Ionisation and recombination

$$
\ce{H + \gamma <-> H+ + e-}
$$

- Cosmological H II regions - The radiation from the first luminous objects will ionise and heat the surrounding IGM once it escapes from their host halos
- Ionisation fraction estimation - equate these two rates and solve for the ionisation fraction $x_\text{e} \equiv n_\text{e}/n_\ce{H}$ of the gas at equilibrium
  - Recombination rate
    - The rate will be proportional to the product of the number density of protons and electrons
    - The gas is pure hydrogen ($n_\text{e} = n_\ce{p}$)
    - The rate depends on the temperature and into which quantum state *n* it recombines
    - On-the-spot approximation - ignore the recombination onto the ground state

### Evolution of an H II region

- Strömgren radius $R_\rm{S}$
  - Ionisation front of an H II region around a massive star where no more flux left
  - Determined by balancing the total number of ionisations and recombinations in a region
- Evolution
  - Initial stage - a newborn star (or a galaxy) ionizes and heats the surrounding dense medium to form a highly ionized H II region *with high pressure*
  - Intermediate stage - the high-pressure region expands and shocks with the ambient medium to sweep up most of the gas in its way and *the density thus decreases*
  - Final stage - the recombination rate decreases accordingly and finally reach an equilibrium state (in hundreds of millions of years >> lifetimes of massive stars) - **final Strömgren radius**

## Ending the Cosmic Dark Ages

- Galaxies were first assembling during the epoch of reionisation
- DM halos - massive enough to support the formation of galaxies
  - Gravitational potential - deeper
  - Viral temperature - higher
- Reionisation phases
  - Pre-overlap: each galaxy produces its own H II regions, divided by IGM
  - Overlap: H II regions start to combine with each other
  - Post-overlap: Most of the IGM is ionized, leaving some 'patches' neutral

### The Dark Ages (after recombination)

- **Streaming velocity** - supersonic relative velocities between DM and gas
  - Before recombination, gas and radiation are coupled, while DM is not affected - after recombination, gas and DM have different velocities
    - $\overline{\Delta v^2}\sim30$ km/s
    - Fluctuates on comoving scales between 3 and 200 Mpc
    - Decays as $a^{-1}$
- Temperature - thermal pressure (sufficient cooling gives lower massive DM halos for galaxy formation)
  - Mean gas temperature decays as $a^{-2}$ when cooling adiabatically
  - The cosmological Jeans mass depends on the temperature - $M_\mathrm{J}\sim a^{-3/2}$

### The first stars

- Population III star

  - Metal-free
  - Massive (tens of solar mass)

- Dominant cooling mechanism - $\ce{H2}$ cooling (cooling in the formation of $\ce{H2}$ in gas phase)
  $$
  \ce{H + e- -> H- + \gamma}\\
  \ce{H- + H -> H2 + e-}
  $$

  - $\ce{H2}$ is vulnerable to photons in Lyman-Werner bands
  - $\ce{H-}$ can be destroyed through photo-detachment

- UV escape fraction - increase with stellar mass

### The first galaxies

- Dominant cooling mechanism - atomic (Ly$\alpha$) cooling
- Pre-galactic halos
  - Gas poor (gas has been blowed away)
  - Below the atomic cooling limit - bursty star formation
  - Above the atomic cooling limit - continuous star formation
- UV escape fraction
  - Radiation hydrodynamics simulations
  - Ionising radiation generally escapes in the directions with small neutral column densities - UV escape fraction can be thought as the solid angular fraction that these 'ionized channels' cover - decrease with galactic mass

### The first black holes

- Strong UV and X-ray radiation during accretion, the latter can penetrate deep into IGM to change the thermal and ionization state of IGM
- Massive Pop III stars ending with BHs may be seeds for SMBHs
